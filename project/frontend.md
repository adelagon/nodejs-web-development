# Building the Frontend

For the sake of time, we will run through the code in **src/amazon-frontend** folder.

## Running the Frontend

* cd into **src/amazon-frontend** folder
* run **npm install**, this installs all the dependencies
* run **npm start**, this starts the development server
* A browser should open in http://localhost:3000/
* If you want to create a production build just run: **npm run build**. This command will minify your code and generate a static html that you can host on your web server as a static asset.
