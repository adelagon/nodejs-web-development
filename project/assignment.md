# Assignment

As you may have noticed, I deliberately gave you an incomplete backend and frontend implementation. If you check the following source code listed here:

```bash
src/amazon-backend/routes/authors.js
src/amazon-backend/routes/publishers.js
src/amazon-frontend/src/Authors.js
src/amazon-frontend/src/Publishers.js
```

Backend lacks implementation of PUT, POST, and DELETE for the author and publisher endpoints.

Frontend lack implementation of the Authors and Publishers React component.

After this training, please take your time to complete these missing features and submit them through **github**. Looking forward for your submissions. :)
