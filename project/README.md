# What are we building?

For this tutorial, assume that you have to build **amazon.com** from the time when it started. As you may know, amazon started selling books from their early days.

We will be building a simple website that will store details about **Books and its Authors and Publishers**. The website should also provide a frontend where you can View, Add, Edit, and Delete book details.

The CTO wants to make sure that the backend and frontend is loosely-coupled. Frontend changes should not affect anything from the Backend.

The Business People also wants to build a native mobile application in the future.

Imagine that you're a full stack web developer and has to deliver end-to-end. From Backend to FrontEnd.
